      <h2>Mentorship Experience</h2>       

      <p>I take the role and responsibility of mentorship seriously. As a graduate student, I served as co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.bostonugwe.com/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">BU Women & Nonbinary People in Economics</a> at Boston University. You can read more about the genesis and evolution of the organization <a href="https://www.bostonugwe.com/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <h3>Activities</h3>         
        <p> 1. Student-Faculty Mentorship Program </p>
        <p> Faculty are matched to a small group of students. Each group meets regularly throughout the year, giving female and underrepresented students an opportunity to receive professional guidance and feedback on navigating graduate school and the job market. We also organize panels targeted to undergraduate students to demystify the process of applying to graduate school.</p>
        <p> 2. Presentation Workshops for Job Market Candidates </p>
        <p> We hold additional job market presentation aimed at having identifying women present to faculty outside their field.  </p>
        <p> 3. Distinguished Speaker Series </p>
        <p> Each year we invite a distinguished economist from an underrepresented group to spend a day at BU. Their visit consists of research seminar and information presentation highlighting their personal trajectory into economics. Past speakers have included: Tavneet Suri (2024), Lisa Barrow (2023), Leah Boustan (2021), and Sandra Black (2020). </p>
        <p> 4. Gender Economics Reading Group </p>
        <p> In bimonthly meetings, students and faculty get together to discuss papers in the field and present research in progress. </p>
