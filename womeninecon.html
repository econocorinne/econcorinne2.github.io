      <h2>Mentorship and Teaching</h2> 

      <p>I take the role and responsibility of mentorship seriously. As a graduate student, I served as co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.bostonugwe.com/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">BU Women & Nonbinary People in Economics</a> at Boston University. Our main activity is a mentorship program that matches faculty to a small group of students. Each group meets regularly throughout the year, giving female and underrepresented students an opportunity to receive professional guidance and feedback on navigating graduate school and the job market. We also organize panels targeted to undergraduate students to demystify the process of applying to graduate school.</p>
