        Why do some occupations pay increasingly more than others over time? To answer this question, I combine hand-collected historical labor market data with a theory-guided accounting framework that allows me to decompose occupational wage inequality into two groups of explanations: productivity and rent sharing. In order to implement this decomposition, I use an equilibrium model of search and matching to derive a mapping from unobserved wage markdowns due to search frictions into a set of measurable labor market statistics for each occupation. I find that productivity, as opposed to rent sharing, explains most of the occupational wage inequality, both in the cross section and over time.

        This paper successfully replicates Autor et al. (2008) and extends their analysis through 2022. The extension to an additional 17 years of analysis underscores the original finding that rising wage inequality was not an episodic event of the 1980s. That being said, overall 90/10 inequality and the college wage premium have plateaued since 2005. Despite overall inequality plateauing, upper-tail 90/50 inequality has continued to increase since 1980 for both men and women. I also find that the composition-adjusted real wages of high school dropouts has caught up with high school graduates in the last decade. Between 2012 and 2022, high school dropouts saw larger real wage gains than any other education group. The combination of these findings is consistent with rising polarization in which employment and wages expand for high-wage and low-wage work.

        This paper explores gender biases in job ads across multiple industries. It examines how job advertisements have historically been tailored towards one gender and the implications for labor market outcomes. Using newspaper data, we identify subtle patterns in job ads that suggest gender preferences in hiring.
