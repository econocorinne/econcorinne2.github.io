        Why do some occupations pay increasingly more than others over time? To answer this question, I combine hand-collected historical labor market data with a theory-guided accounting framework that allows me to decompose occupational wage inequality into two groups of explanations: productivity and rent sharing. In order to implement this decomposition, I use an equilibrium model of search and matching to derive a mapping from unobserved wage markdowns due to search frictions into a set of measurable labor market statistics for each occupation. I find that productivity, as opposed to rent sharing, explains most of the occupational wage inequality, both in the cross section and over time.

      <button class="button" onclick="toggleAbstract('paper5-abstract')">Abstract</button>
      <p id="gender-abstract" class="abstract">
        This paper explores gender biases in job ads across multiple industries. It examines how job advertisements have historically been tailored towards one gender and the implications for labor market outcomes. Using newspaper data, we identify subtle patterns in job ads that suggest gender preferences in hiring.
