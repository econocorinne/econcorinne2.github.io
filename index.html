    <p>Welcome! I am currently a Dissertation Fellow at the Boston Federal Reserve and a PhD student in the Economics Department at Boston University. My research interests are in labor 
      economics and macroeconomics. Before starting graduate school, I worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. and the U.N. World Food 
      Programme in Dakar, Senegal. </p>
