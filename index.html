      <p>Welcome! I am currently a PhD student in the Economics Department at Boston University with research interests in labor 
        economics and macroeconomics. Recently I was a Dissertation Fellow at the Boston Federal Reserve. Before starting graduate school, I worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., and the U.N. World Food 
        Programme in Dakar, Senegal.</p>
